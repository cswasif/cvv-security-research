## Conclusion

The mapping demonstrates clear and significant non-compliance with multiple PCI DSS requirements. The identified vulnerabilities, particularly regarding CVV data protection and network security, represent fundamental failures in meeting PCI DSS standards. The remediation roadmap provides a systematic approach to achieving compliance while addressing the security gaps identified in the paper.

These findings strongly support the thesis premise that enhanced CVV validation and stricter PCI DSS compliance are necessary to prevent Card-Not-Present fraud and protect sensitive payment data. The compliance gaps identified provide concrete evidence of the need for comprehensive security improvements in payment applications.
