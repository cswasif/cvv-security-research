# PCI DSS Compliance Implications from In-App Payment Security Analysis

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the PCI DSS compliance implications derived from the security vulnerabilities identified in "Revisiting Online Privacy and Security Mechanisms Applied in the In-App Payment Realm from the Consumers' Perspective." The findings reveal significant gaps between current in-app payment implementations and PCI DSS requirements, particularly regarding CVV data protection, encryption standards, and secure data transmission.

## PCI DSS Requirement Mapping

### Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data

**Finding**: CVV data transmitted in plain text after TLS decryption
- **PCI DSS 3.2.1 Section 3.4**: "Render PAN unreadable anywhere it is stored"
- **Non-compliance**: The paper found that "credit card numbers, full owner name, and the CVV security code exist in plain text when purchasing with L'Osteria app while paying with Mastercard/Visa option."
- **Implication**: Direct violation of PCI DSS requirements for protecting stored cardholder data, as CVV is considered sensitive authentication data that must be protected with strong cryptography.

**Finding**: Lack of additional encryption for CVV data
- **PCI DSS 3.2.1 Section 3.4.1**: "Use strong cryptography and security protocols"
- **Non-compliance**: The research states "most analyzed apps do not use additional security measures to encrypt the user's data after TLS encryption."
- **Implication**: Failure to implement defense-in-depth encryption strategies required by PCI DSS standards.

### Requirement 4: Encrypt Transmission of Cardholder Data Across Open, Public Networks

**Finding**: CVV data vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
- **PCI DSS 3.2.1 Section 4.1**: "Use strong cryptography and security protocols to safeguard sensitive cardholder data during transmission over open, public networks"
- **Non-compliance**: The researchers successfully executed a man-in-the-middle attack and extracted CVV data, demonstrating that "attackers can exploit this situation, especially when a consumer orders and the phone is connected to public networks."
- **Implication**: Inadequate protection of cardholder data during transmission, violating PCI DSS encryption requirements.

**Finding**: Single-layer encryption (TLS only)
- **PCI DSS 3.2.1 Section 4.1.1**: "Ensure wireless networks transmitting cardholder data or connected to the cardholder data environment use industry best practices"
- **Non-compliance**: The paper notes that "additional security measures such as hashing and salting... would have been desirable" but were absent.
- **Implication**: Failure to implement industry best practices for wireless network security as required by PCI DSS.

### Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems and Applications

**Finding**: Known vulnerabilities remain unaddressed
- **PCI DSS 3.2.1 Section 6.5**: "Address common coding vulnerabilities in software-development processes"
- **Non-compliance**: The paper concludes that "despite efforts of the research community to highlight security flaws... fintech companies still have work to do to fix these long-lasting vulnerabilities."
- **Implication**: Failure to address known security vulnerabilities in payment applications, violating PCI DSS secure development requirements.

**Finding**: Inconsistent security implementations
- **PCI DSS 3.2.1 Section 6.4**: "Follow change control processes for all changes to system components"
- **Non-compliance**: The research found "significant differences in the qualitative use of the trackers" and security measures across applications.
- **Implication**: Lack of standardized security controls across payment applications, indicating inadequate change management processes.

### Requirement 8: Identify and Authenticate Access to System Components

**Finding**: Login credentials transmitted in plain text
- **PCI DSS 3.2.1 Section 8.2.3**: "Passwords/phrases must meet the following: Require a minimum length of at least seven characters and contain both numeric and alphabetic characters"
- **Non-compliance**: The paper found that "many apps sent login data (email, password) in plain text after TLS decryption."
- **Implication**: Inadequate protection of authentication credentials, violating PCI DSS access control requirements.

### Requirement 12: Maintain a Policy that Addresses Information Security for All Personnel

**Finding**: Lack of transparency in data handling practices
- **PCI DSS 3.2.1 Section 12.8**: "Maintain and implement policies and procedures to manage service providers with whom cardholder data is shared"
- **Non-compliance**: The research found "communications with servers neither listed in the privacy policies of the apps nor the static analysis."
- **Implication**: Failure to properly manage third-party service providers and disclose data sharing practices as required by PCI DSS.

## Critical Compliance Gaps

### CVV Data Protection Failures

1. **Storage Violations**: CVV data found in plain text format during transmission
2. **Encryption Insufficiencies**: Single-layer TLS encryption without additional protection
3. **Transmission Security**: Vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks
4. **Third-party Access**: Potential exposure to unauthorized third parties

### Security Control Deficiencies

1. **Defense-in-Depth**: Missing additional encryption layers beyond TLS
2. **Secure Coding**: Known vulnerabilities remain unaddressed
3. **Access Controls**: Inadequate protection of authentication credentials
4. **Third-party Management**: Lack of transparency in data sharing practices

## Risk Assessment

### High-Risk Areas

1. **CVV Data Exposure**: Direct violation of PCI DSS requirements for sensitive authentication data protection
2. **Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability**: Demonstrated ability to intercept CVV data during transmission
3. **Third-party Data Sharing**: Uncontrolled sharing of payment data with external entities
4. **Known Vulnerability Persistence**: Failure to address previously identified security issues

### Compliance Impact

- **Immediate Non-compliance**: Direct violations of PCI DSS requirements 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12
- **Audit Failures**: Current implementations would fail PCI DSS compliance assessments
- **Regulatory Risk**: Potential penalties and sanctions for non-compliance
- **Customer Trust Impact**: Security failures undermine customer confidence in payment security

## Recommendations for Compliance

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Implement Additional CVV Encryption**: Add application-level encryption for CVV data beyond TLS
2. **Address Known Vulnerabilities**: Systematically fix identified security issues
3. **Enhance Third-party Controls**: Implement proper service provider management
4. **Strengthen Access Controls**: Improve authentication and authorization mechanisms

### Long-term Compliance Strategy

1. **Regular Security Assessments**: Implement continuous monitoring and vulnerability management
2. **Standardized Security Controls**: Establish consistent security implementations across all applications
3. **Enhanced Training**: Ensure development teams understand PCI DSS requirements
4. **Third-party Due Diligence**: Implement comprehensive vendor security assessments

## Conclusion

The paper's findings reveal significant PCI DSS compliance gaps in current in-app payment implementations. The identified vulnerabilities, particularly regarding CVV data protection, encryption standards, and secure data transmission, represent direct violations of PCI DSS requirements. These findings strongly support the thesis premise that enhanced CVV validation and stricter PCI DSS compliance are necessary to prevent Card-Not-Present fraud and protect sensitive payment data.

The research provides concrete evidence that current implementations are failing to meet basic PCI DSS requirements, creating opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit these gaps. This underscores the critical need for the enhanced CVV validation protocols and compliance measures advocated in the thesis research.
