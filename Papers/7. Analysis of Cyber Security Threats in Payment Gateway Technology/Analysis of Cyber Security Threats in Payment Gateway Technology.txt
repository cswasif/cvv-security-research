Abstract—There has been a meteoric rise in the use of
online payment systems recently. Multiple e-payment systems
exist, each designed to provide the highest degree of security
while maintaining the greatest possible convenience for online
shoppers. Cyber-attack techniques, on the other hand, are
developing at the same rapid pace as security mechanisms. The
authors of this paper examine the history of electronic
payment systems, from the development of the corresponding
language through the emergence of today's standard electronic
payment systems. It also reveals a lack of security measures
and approaches to fixing the problem. The current survey
research makes a significant contribution by outlining the state
of the electronic payment system framework and_ the
possibilities it presents for the development of e-commerce in
the future. The rates of suspicious purchases, which will serve
as a yardstick in the creation of a trustworthy e-payment
system, have been briefly discussed and analyzed.

I. INTRODUCTION

Digital payment systems are increasingly relied upon by
both buyers and sellers due to the proliferation of the internet
and IT. Internet commerce refers to the exchange of products
and services, as well as monetary transactions, over the
world wide web. E-payment, often referred to as online
payment or EDI (Electronic data exchange), is one such
example. Internet banking, often known as an E-banking
system, has quickly become the most widely used form of
electronic payment processing in today's digital society. This
is true across a wide range of industries, from retail to travel
to finance. It is possible to conduct monetary transactions for
the purchase of goods and services electronically, without
the need of physical currency or paper checks, via the use of
an E- payment or e-banking system. Due to the widespread
use of online shopping and banking, electronic payment
technology has entered a new phase during the last several
decades. A rising number of people are making purchases
online, and this trend indicates that e-payment systems are
becoming more popular. Online banking services are quickly
replacing traditional methods of monetary exchange and are
therefore seen as essential components of the modern
financial system. These services provide convenient round-

the-clock access to banking options and are designed to
make online banking more user-friendly. A relatively small
fraction of internet users actually used an online bank in
2012, according to a study published in [1].

Establishing the necessary technological infrastructure,
such as an E-payment system, is a crucial part of the e-
banking system. There are two main types of electronic
payment systems: those based on currency (like E-cash and
pre-paid cards) and those based on accounts (like credit
cards, debit cards, and electronic checks). Time and place
play a significant role in the M-payment (mobile payment)
system, which facilitates the electronic payment process
through a smart device. When it comes to paying for public
services, the government sector is home to a plethora of
businesses that provide E-payment options for residents. As
the field of information and communication technology
(ICT) has advanced, mobile services have become more
popular and widely used, contributing not only to the public
sector but also to commercial or corporate activity. Research
from ARCOTEL [2] indicates that public areas have
coverage of over 90% on their mobile devices, with access
topping 100%. A financial organization in Ecuador reported
that in 2014 [3].

Knowing and meeting the needs of one's customers is
essential in E-banking. In order to increase the number of
people using E-payment systems, it is necessary to better
control the variables that influence their decisions to do so.
The case study demonstrates that few clients are willing to
use the system despite the banking industry's heavy
investment in internet technologies.

As such, it is clear that further investigation into the
elements that affect the spread of electronic payment systems
is necessary. Different types of electronic banking have been
investigated to see what aspects of E-payment adoption are
most important to consumers. E-payment system users often
worry about the security of making financial transactions
online. When the stakes are great, trust becomes a huge
issue. As a result, it's reasonable to assume that consumers’
level of comfort with E-payment is significantly influenced
by the assurance they feel in the system's safety and
reliability [4].

More than a decade has passed since the first steps were
taken to create the M-payment system. Despite this, the
actual acceptance of M-payment is far different from the
ideal. 70% of Indian consumers are familiar with the M-
payment system, although they have yet to utilize it. Fear of
privacy and security flaws in the various services is a major
factor in their low adoption rates. A variety of financial
activities, including E- recharge, E-bill payments, and cash
withdraw from ATMs, are now possible in our nation thanks
to the widespread use of mobile phones and associated
services [5]. The information community, however, is of the
opinion that M-commerce must advance in the field of the
M-payment system in order to compete with the already
available services for personal computers and smart devices.

Mobile payment apps, which have emerged in response
to the proliferation of e-commerce, need the use of secure
mobile payment mechanisms. Moreover, the present
cryptographic techniques are fairly easy to exploit, making
authentication and authorization vulnerable. Thus, the focus
of this research is on a security protocol designed to solve the
vast majority of problems with M-payments in a wireless
setting [6].

The major goal of this research is to learn how one's
sense of safety and trust influences their propensity to use an
electronic payment method. The safety of electronic payment
systems is another motivation to study this area.
Additionally, the study presents the statistics graph on yearly
online fraud rate.

Situational Analysis: The lack of skill on the part of users
or administrators often poses the greatest threat to network
safety. Even if these performance indicators should be
applied in many wireless networks, the current security
measures are insufficient to meet the need for a safe and
secure network in the future, especially given the prevalence
of skilled and persistent hackers. However, the symmetric
strategy has several limitations as contrasted with the
asymmetric approach. The ability to determine the message's
sender based on the digital signature is an example of how
the asymmetric technique improves upon the symmetric one.
Since a third party with access to the shared key may
construct a symmetric ciphertext message, its origination
cannot be determined.

II. LITERATURE REVIEW

In this part, we'll go through the e-Payment transaction
techniques shown in Figure 1. All of which have been
presented by separate researchers; the survey study we're
looking at here analyses and evaluates these techniques
relying on their performance indicators and describes them in
short.

Due to the rapid evolution of electronic media and
communication channels over the last three decades, most
banks now implement a multichannel policy that allows
customers to access their accounts via a variety of different
channels. In 1970, the world's first automated teller machine
was introduced. Since then, we've seen the advent of
telephonic banking in the 1980s, internet banking in the
1990s, and m-banking in the 2010s. However, the pace at
which electronic payment systems are being used is lower
than the rate at which they are being developed. Information
leakage by shops and other parties, as well as concerns about
data security and privacy, remain significant barriers to
widespread use of electronic payments. Issues of this kind
have a direct, detrimental effect on the popularity of online
banking and the confidence of its customers.

[7] has introduced a secure electronic currency
transaction mechanism for ride-hailing services that protects
users’ anonymity. To further increase the adaptability of
transaction systems, the author also devised a technique for
verified hash chaining to preserve the divisibility and
reusability of electronic payments. In [8], a one-time
password system is described as the mobile payment method.
Whereas a new architecture for mobile payment systems was
presented in [9], employing digital signatures and pseudo-
identity mechanisms to keep mobile wallets safe. Both [10]
and [11] show that there is a connection between a user's true
name and their alias. The user has the option of keeping track
of all transactions here.

[12] presented the results of a research on the elements
that influence Iranians’ trust in making internet payments.
They gathered data on transaction details, system
accessibility, and user friendliness to create a security model
for the payment system. The authors then compared their
findings to those of another research. Another work that
takes a similar tack is [13], which analyzed the ways in
which many elements (such as social media, marketing
tactics, trust, usability, connections with consumers,
accessibility, etc.) affect the e-market.

Several modern electronic payment systems exist, each
optimized for use on mobile devices and promising improved
communication at reduced expense. However, keeping a
user's identity secret is difficult since existing payment
systems only provide transaction privacy, and their high-
security features fall short of expectations.

[14] updated the e-Payment system for the blind and
visually impaired from the perspective of user anonymity.
Using a customer's mobile phone as a surrogate, this
approach may also be used to the evolution of the retail
payment system. The issues with users’ anonymity were
addressed and security flaws were highlighted in [15] and
[16]. Users! day-to-day lives and productivity have improved
thanks to the widespread usage of electronic payment
methods through mobile or smartphones. Electronic
payments made using mobile devices are commonplace in
developing markets.

But the latest communication technology is the rapid
response code (i.e., QR code), which allows for the storage,
transfer, and identification of data, and which can be read by
a mobile device anywhere. The use of QR codes in highly
secure systems like financial transactions is on the rise.

A innovative mobile payment system for cooperative
businesses in developing nations is presented in [17]. As

internet access is a challenge in certain underdeveloped
nations, this research enhances the previous QR payment
technique by finding a solution to the connectivity issue.

Furthermore, authentication and QR __ encrypted
information were implemented as two © significant
components to further strengthen security. As a result, the
proposed plan makes it simpler and safer to send money
through a cell phone.

This technique is relevant to contemporary developing
nations, the authors conclude codes were launched in [18] as
a new method of user interface and exploitation, allowing
information to be embedded in a graphical representation and
accessed through mobile applications on smartphones. Due
to its useful properties, particularly for the mobile payment
system, QR codes were also used in another study [19]. In
addition, a visual cryptographic mechanism was proposed
and demonstrated, showing that m-payment authentication is
both possible and secure. With the use of biometrics, the
authors of [20] offer a digital card module they call the
swing-pay technique. The suggested approach aims to
provide fingerprint authentication. Through the use of GSM,
a power unit, Cortex-M3, a Bluetooth device, etc., a safe and
effective payment system is provided. The results of the
experiments show that the user might get a message from the
server confirming the successful completion of the
transaction and requesting payment.

The most widely used use for mobile payment systems is
transit payment services, while there are many more e-
payment applications. Before, travelers had to keep their
private information hidden from transportation agencies,
banks, mobile phone companies, smart card companies, and
others who needed it. Accordingly, researchers presented a
straightforward method of the privacy-preserving payment
system to protect the mass transport information of
passengers. In addition, this method makes it possible to
provide discounts for transferring passengers and to offer
postpaid services.

The major motivation behind most suggested electronic
payment methods is to increase the degree of security
throughout the electronic transaction process. However, non-
repudiation is not a feature of other more conventional
approaches. As a result, a rogue node or attacker may simply
prevent the online purchase from going through, potentially
costing the store money. Researchers in [21] looked at a
method of anonymously paying for cloud services in order to
get around this problem. The suggested technique satisfies
the non-repudiation condition from the client end while
incurring little computational overhead. The authors
conclude that the suggested electronic payment method is
superior to the alternatives in terms of fairness, security, and
efficiency, and is therefore well suited for use in real-time
cloud computing.

Similar methods for protecting a customer's identity
while making an online cash purchase were proposed by the
authors of a study titled [22]. An offline electronic currency
system with an unknown revocation was presented as a result
of this work. The suggested research also guarantees the
capability of preventing retail fraud. Similar offline e-cash
payment system research is suggested in [23]. In addition,
the authors developed a protocol for the electronic renewal of
cash, which allows users to swap out their old currency for a
new one before it expires.

In [24], the author creates a safe and reliable framework
for mobile micropayments. An efficient way for digital
currency systems is provided by the author's use of a hash
chaining approach to security, together with a basic public
key cryptosystem that allows for safe routing during m-
transactions. Alternatively, in [25], the authors provided an
expanded version of the earlier research that looked at the
safety concerns associated with a mobile agent-based
micropayment system. In contrast to the prior research, this
article presents a lightweight, safe, and dependable technique
for using offline payments in a mobile commerce system.

III. E-PAYMENT, TERMS AND CONCEPTS

In the late 1950s, the first electronic payment system was
developed, and since then, it has grown significantly in both
size and complexity. As a follow-up to the conventional
payment system, the e-Money transaction-based payment
mechanism emerged. For the first time, money could be sent
digitally without going via a single processing hub.
Electronic checks (e-Checks) and credit card data are sent
from consumers to online retailers and financial institutions
using encrypted private communication channels. This
procedure paved the way for a new path in the evolution of a
protocol for exchanging digital money. However, the
widespread use of digital currency has far-reaching
ramifications for the monetary transaction system, far above
the mere improvement in transaction efficiency. To that end,
we've included a quick glossary of E-payment system terms
in Figure- below.

ONLIINEBANKING PAYMENT GATEWAY

Fig. 2. A standard E- Payment service framework

The E-payment procedure involves a number of different
processing steps. Services like gateways, processors,
providers, systems, and merchant accounts are examples of
such amenities.

Each service offering has its own unique set of features
and functions, but they all contribute to the successful
conclusion of an E-transaction and the smooth execution of
an online transaction in one way or another.

The payment system is the initial service since it is
responsible for relaying the platform's payment demand to
the payment gateway. The next step in the payment process
is for the payment processor to check the customer's
credentials and verify that there are sufficient funds in the
account to complete the transaction. The E-transaction is
permitted, and the funds are forwarded from the user's

2023 3rd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE)

account if there are adequate funds. Once again, the gateway
notifies the site admin with the customer account after
receiving the transaction status from the user.

An organization that handles the payment gateway or
related services is known as a payment service operator. The
payment system is referred to as such since it facilitates
monetary transactions and has several functions.

PayPal, for instance, is a payment operator that provides
a variety of payment services. The funds from a customer's
debit or credit card purchase are deposited into a separate
bank account designated as the merchants upon completion
of the electronic transaction. Customers often need to set up
the merchant profile with their payment service provider in
order to receive E-payment. Customer funds deposited into a
merchant account are transferred on a routine basis. PayPal,
Google Check, and Authorize.Net are the three most widely
used services for accepting credit card payments online. All
of these factors contribute to the dealer's ability to accept
electronic payments from their customers. It's no secret that
(www.paypal.com) has swiftly become the industry standard
for handling online payments. PayPal was originally
launched as a means for users to send and receive money
directly, similar to the way that auctions work on eBay.
While "Google Checkout" offers an online payment option,
it is limited to credit card purchases.

Authorize.Net is a second alternative payment processor.
When it comes to credit card payments, the Internet handles
everything from the dealers to the financing processing
infrastructure.

The e-commerce companies use an electronic payment
technique to facilitate a smoother transaction and an easier
payment process for their clients.

There are several advantages, such as;

a) Time efficiency increases both the efficiency
and the convenience of business dealings. Since
all it takes to complete a transaction is a single
mouse click, customers’ time is not wasted.

b) Costs are reduced, and even a layperson can set
up an account and begin accepting payments
online in a matter of minutes.

c) Lowers operating and processing costs as a
result of decreasing technology prices; for
instance, today's computers are dirt cheap, and
access to the internet is free in most of the
globe. Due to the efficiency of e-payment
systems, clients may cut down on administrative
tasks and time spent processing payments.

TV. PRIMARY PAYMENTS METHODS

The past several decades have seen the development of
many e-Payment transfer methods due to the proliferation of
the online business transaction system. Numerous online
payment options are now available. Based on the information
being shared, they may be broken down into three distinct
categories.

i. smart/digital card-based e-payment system,
i. e-Check system

iii. online credit card payment method.

Debit and credit cards, according to recent data, have
become the most flexible form of digital payment. According
to the data we have, credit and debit cards are used for more
than 80% of all online purchases. Customers! credibility and
the online store's accessibility are both improved by the
customers’ use of convenient and trusted payment options.

For consumers and businesses alike, the credit/debit card
transaction system has proven to be the most popular and
extensively used innovation. There are several benefits to
making payments in this digital format rather to the
conventional ones, which lack any really innovative
elements. Reliability, confidentiality, high transaction speed,
improved mobility, reduced fraud risk, and a host of other
attributes rank high on the list of importance. Moreover, both
consumers and business owners are increasingly turning to
debit and credit card-based e-card payment systems as a
means of doing business.

Those who have utilized bank-issued digital cards will
find this way to be ideal. To add, customers! accounts may be
accessed using their debit cards. But new concerns about
security have arisen as a result. This implies that e-card
payment aims to address a wide range of issues that plague
online merchants, such as insufficient verification and
credit/debit card fraud. In addition, it hopes to allay the
concerns of internet shoppers who worry about credit card
fraud, such as the need to provide sensitive financial details
across several websites and the ongoing hassle of attempting
to convey confidential details over the internet. Paying with a
credit card or debit card is quick and easy.

To make a purchase, a consumer must supply their credit
card details to the vendor, and the card organization takes
care of the rest.

Digital wallets are a type of e-payment transaction that is
analogous to traditional wallets used in brick-and-mortar
establishments. The user's bank account may be directly
accessed via the digital wallet, just as with a debit or credit
card. The most common web browsers, such as Mozilla
Firefox and Google Chrome, will often prompt online stores
to permanently store sensitive data, such as a customer's
billing or shipping address.

Customers may speed through the payment procedure by
just clicking their cursor instead of repeatedly putting in their
personal information.

Online buying using a smartphone app that doubles as a
digital wallet is becoming more common. In this transaction,
data is saved and shared across participants via mobile
devices. The widespread acceptance of this strategy may be
attributed to the convenience it brings to online buying. If
you need to move money from one bank account to another,
you may use the electronic funds transfer technique, which is
a specialized kind of online money transfer. Electronic bill
payment, insurance debts, utility bills, and mortgage
payments are the most often conducted e-fund transactions.

The "payment service operator technique" is another
common practice. This service gives online stores access to
many currency options via a defined third-party network.
This is an effective way for shops to protect themselves
against criminals. This makes it safe for online merchants to
accept payments by transferring funds to the account of the
payment processor. Some examples of widely used online

2023 3rd International Conference on Advance Computing and Innovative Technologies in Engineering (ICACITE)

payment systems are Mastercard, Paytm, Payoneer, PayPal,
Paysafecard, etc.

Online payments and electronic currency exchange,
however, are seeing a surge in popularity with smart card-
based e-Payment systems.

At first, smart cards function as a storage medium for
information with built-in transaction processing capability,
thanks to their memory chips and _ integrated
microprocessors. A unique encrypted key on the smart card
is paired with a secret key saved on the cardholder's
processor for further protection. These cards are used for a
variety of purposes, such as paying tolls on highways,
recharging prepaid cellphones, etc., because of their
adaptability. Smart payment systems like this are becoming
more commonplace as m-Commerce develops. E-commerce
couldn't function without e-Payment systems, which enable
the electronic transfer of payments for the purchase of
products and services, as previously mentioned. The
widespread expansion of e-Payment transactions is mostly
attributable to the quick proliferation of various electronic
payment systems. Before the advent of the internet, debit and
credit cards were already commonly used in industrialized
nations.

V. SECURITY ASSESEMNT OF E-PAYMENT FRAMEWORK

One of the major reasons highlighted in business analysis
as holding back the development of the e-commerce system
is the lack of trust, privacy, and security. The proliferation of
online payment methods has made protecting users’ personal
information and financial transactions paramount. This
section primarily discusses the security needs of advanced e-
payment systems and highlights the research efforts that have
been focused on these protocols. The goal of developing a
secure, low-cost, and efficient security protocol for existing
and future e-payment systems is driving the fast expansion of
security features in tandem with the expansion of digital
technologies. The digital signature of the cardholder, and in
some cases a picture of the cardholder as an identification
factor for credit card holder, is provided by the merchant to
aid in the validation of the cardholder's identity when using
emerging e-transaction methods such an e-card or digital
wallet. The card number, verification code, and billing
information are all that's needed to verify a cardholder's
identification during the digital transaction. Internet-based
fraud, product returns, non-delivery claims, and similar
issues are among the most pressing problems that stores must
solve. The fraud rate in the current e-payment system is quite
high when compared to the fraud rate in conventional
payment systems studied in [26-27].

Typically, cybercriminals have many opportunities to
steal or alter transaction details. This will allow the thief to
use the stolen information to shop online and have items sent
to the fictitious address. If any fraudulent activity is
discovered at this time, the perpetrators will likely leave the
area immediately. Online shoppers [28-30] are discouraged
by the frequent occurrence of data loss related to online
transactions. While it's true that hackers often target high-
profile shops, the vast majority of people mistakenly believe
that ordinary Internet users are at particularly high risk of
being scammed. As a result, an effective security model is
presented to deal with these security issues, which may
eventually become an immunity factor for the users of online
payment systems and for retailers. In this part, we analyze

the most well-known and influential security procedures,
which serve as guides for creating a trustworthy online
payment system.

SET (secure electronic transaction) and SSL (secure
socket layer) are the two  industry-standard [31-32]
technologies for online payment security. To prevent
unauthorized access to sensitive information while in transit
over the internet, both SET and SSL protocols encrypt and
digitize the data beforehand. Thus, there is a pressing need in
the present for an effective, dependable, and trustworthy
security protocol that may serve as a template for the safety
and security of both the present and the future of e-payments.

VI. RATE OF FINANCIAL FRAUDS ACROSS SECTORS

The following criteria were used to ensure that the
examinations had the maximum likelihood of success and
that all samples met a common standard. During testing,
variables were minimized or eliminated whenever practical.

In 2021, the attempted fraud rate as a percentage of the
population rose to 2.7%, from 1.4% in 2014, as detailed by
the ACI. We also looked at the fraud rate throughout the
holiday shopping seasons of 2014 and 2021. Millions of
retail transactions were affected by fraud efforts in both
years.

Increased use of smartphones and other mobile devices
has spurred growth in the e-commerce sector. Although
commercial firms have yet to implement the same degree of
protection on mobile devices as they do on the internet,
attackers are aware that mobile devices are more susceptible
than PCs or laptops.

In 2021, "Anti-fraud command center" data showed that
mobile devices accounted for 52% of all attempts at client e-
payment transactions. A total of 162% more fraudulent
purchases were made using mobile devices in the same year
compared to the previous year, whereas online fraud grew by
just 5%.17% of gaming transactions are fraudulent, followed
by 28% of financial transfers, and 43% of airlines and travel
services, as reported by RSA. This trend has affected the
majority of shops today. The proportion of fraudulent
purchases at major stores is shown in the following pie chart
(Figure-3).

The overall rate of fraud transitions was likewise found
to be greater than the overall rate of valid transaction in the
case study. In the airline industry, for instance, a valid ticket
booking will cost you $606, while a fraudulent one would set
you back $1,930. In 2021, the most often attacked nations
are those with the most global prominence (e.g., US, UK,
and China). Nearly three-quarters (75%) of all attacks

originate from these nations. Many stores in the United
Kingdom and the United States have extensive firsthand
knowledge of the challenges posed by online fraud, which is
why these two nations place such a premium on finding
effective solutions.

VII. CONCLUSION

The purpose of this study is to investigate the mobile
payment system and to get a complete understanding of the
ways and current tactics that might be advantageous for both
stakeholders (i.e., merchants and consumers) with regards to
e-payment security and usability. The online credit card
transaction technique, e-Check, e-fund, and smart card
payment services are all covered in the research after an
introduction to the e-payment system's jargon. Using data
gathered from reviews of relevant literature, it assessed how
well-established online payment methods stood up to the
most popular attacks and fraud techniques of the time. This
in-depth analysis presents a report on the current state of
online and mobile payment methods. Comparative
examination of various payment methods reveals that all e-
payment methods have advantages and disadvantages in
terms of personal information protection, financial
confidentiality, and transaction speed.
