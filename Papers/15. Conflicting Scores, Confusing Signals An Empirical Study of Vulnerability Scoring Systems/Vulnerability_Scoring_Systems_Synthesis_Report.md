# Vulnerability Scoring Systems Synthesis Report: Application to CVV Validation and PCI DSS Compliance

## Executive Summary

This synthesis report examines the empirical study "Conflicting Scores, Confusing Signals: An Empirical Study of Vulnerability Scoring Systems" and applies its findings to the context of Card Verification Value (CVV) validation vulnerabilities and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance. The original study reveals significant inconsistencies among four major vulnerability scoring systems (CVSS, SSVC, EPSS, and Exploitability Index) when evaluating the same vulnerabilities, highlighting challenges in vulnerability prioritization and triage. This synthesis adapts these insights to develop a comprehensive framework for detecting, assessing, and mitigating CVV validation vulnerabilities in payment gateways, with a focus on non-AI based prevention strategies that align with PCI DSS requirements.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Context

Card-Not-Present (CNP) fraud continues to pose significant challenges to payment security, with vulnerabilities in CVV validation mechanisms being a critical attack vector. Effective vulnerability assessment and prioritization are essential for securing payment gateways against these threats. However, as demonstrated in the study of vulnerability scoring systems, inconsistent vulnerability assessments can lead to misaligned security priorities and potentially overlooked critical vulnerabilities.

### 1.2 Research Objectives

This synthesis aims to:

1. Analyze the implications of vulnerability scoring inconsistencies for CVV validation security
2. Develop a specialized vulnerability scoring approach for payment gateway CVV validation mechanisms
3. Map vulnerability assessment methodologies to PCI DSS compliance requirements
4. Propose non-AI based prevention strategies informed by robust vulnerability scoring
5. Create practical implementation guidelines for secure merchant integration

### 1.3 Methodology Overview

This synthesis applies the empirical findings from the vulnerability scoring systems study to the specific domain of payment gateway security, with a focus on CVV validation. It integrates vulnerability assessment methodologies with PCI DSS compliance requirements to create a comprehensive framework for detecting and mitigating CVV validation vulnerabilities.

## 2. Vulnerability Scoring Systems: Fundamentals and Limitations

### 2.1 Overview of Major Vulnerability Scoring Systems

#### 2.1.1 Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

CVSS provides a standardized approach to assessing vulnerability severity through base, temporal, and environmental metrics. It produces a numerical score (0-10) that can be translated into qualitative severity ratings (Low, Medium, High, Critical). While widely adopted, CVSS focuses primarily on the technical characteristics of vulnerabilities rather than their specific impact in different contexts.

#### 2.1.2 Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC)

SSVC takes a decision-tree approach to vulnerability assessment, considering factors such as exploitation state, technical impact, automatable, and mission/well-being impact. Unlike CVSS, SSVC produces action recommendations (Track, Track*, Attend, Act) rather than numerical scores, allowing for greater organizational flexibility in interpretation.

#### 2.1.3 Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)

EPSS uses machine learning to predict the likelihood that a vulnerability will be exploited in the wild within the next 30 days. It provides a probability score (0-1) based on various vulnerability characteristics and historical exploitation data. However, as the study reveals, EPSS often fails to predict exploitation with high confidence before it occurs.

#### 2.1.4 Exploitability Index

The Exploitability Index assesses the likelihood of exploitation based on various factors, providing a score that indicates how easily a vulnerability could be exploited. It serves as a complementary metric to other scoring systems, focusing specifically on the exploitation potential.

### 2.2 Key Limitations Identified in the Empirical Study

#### 2.2.1 Inconsistency Among Scoring Systems

The study revealed minimal agreement among scoring systems when evaluating the same vulnerabilities. Statistical measures including Spearman's Rho, Kendall's Tau, Cohen's Kappa, and Krippendorff's Alpha consistently confirmed that no pair of systems aligns reliably. This inconsistency means that the perceived severity and prioritization of a vulnerability may vary significantly depending on the chosen scoring system.

#### 2.2.2 Challenges in Triage and Prioritization

Scoring systems showed minimal agreement on which vulnerabilities to prioritize, with only 5 vulnerabilities overlapping across all four systems in their top-100 lists. Large tie groups—such as 198 vulnerabilities sharing a top-20 score in CVSS—further undermine the ability to rank vulnerabilities meaningfully, leaving security teams with broad, undifferentiated lists and no clear path for action.

#### 2.2.3 Limited Predictive Power

EPSS, the only system designed specifically to predict future exploitation, rarely did so with high confidence before an exploit was known. Only 19.9% of known exploited vulnerabilities in the KEV catalog had an EPSS score > 0.5 before exploitation, and just 8.3% ever reached an EPSS score > 0.9. This highlights the immense difficulty of real-time threat forecasting.

#### 2.2.4 Lack of Consistency Across Vulnerability Types

The study found that scoring systems do not behave consistently across specific vulnerability types (CWEs). Analysis of the top five CWEs revealed wide variability in scoring and score agreement for vulnerabilities within the same CWE, suggesting that vulnerability type alone is insufficient to predict consistent scoring outcomes.

## 3. Application to CVV Validation Vulnerabilities

### 3.1 CVV Validation Vulnerability Categories

Based on the insights from vulnerability scoring systems, we can categorize CVV validation vulnerabilities in payment gateways into the following types:

#### 3.1.1 Bypass Vulnerabilities

These vulnerabilities allow attackers to complete transactions without providing valid CVV data. They can be further categorized into:

- **Value-level bypass**: Vulnerabilities that allow specific CVV values (e.g., empty string, all zeros) to be accepted as valid
- **Parameter-level bypass**: Vulnerabilities that allow the CVV parameter to be omitted or modified in the request
- **Control flow bypass**: Vulnerabilities that allow the CVV validation step to be skipped entirely in the transaction processing flow

#### 3.1.2 Validation Logic Vulnerabilities

These vulnerabilities exist in the implementation of CVV validation algorithms:

- **Weak validation algorithms**: Implementations that do not properly validate the CVV format or value
- **Insufficient entropy checks**: Validation that does not account for common patterns or easily guessable values
- **Timing attack vulnerabilities**: Implementations that leak information about valid CVVs through timing differences

#### 3.1.3 Integration Vulnerabilities

These vulnerabilities occur at the integration points between merchants and payment processors:

- **Insecure transmission**: CVV data transmitted over insecure channels
- **Improper storage**: Temporary or permanent storage of CVV data in violation of PCI DSS
- **Logging vulnerabilities**: CVV data captured in logs or debugging output

### 3.2 Specialized Vulnerability Scoring for CVV Validation

To address the limitations of existing vulnerability scoring systems in the context of CVV validation, we propose a specialized scoring approach that incorporates payment-specific factors:

#### 3.2.1 CVV-CVSS: Enhanced CVSS for CVV Validation

Building on the CVSS framework, CVV-CVSS adds payment-specific metrics to the base score calculation:

- **Transaction Volume Impact**: Assesses the potential number of transactions affected
- **Financial Loss Potential**: Estimates the potential monetary impact
- **Detection Difficulty**: Evaluates how difficult it is to detect exploitation of the vulnerability
- **Compliance Impact**: Assesses the impact on PCI DSS compliance

#### 3.2.2 CVV Vulnerability Priority Matrix

To address the prioritization challenges identified in the study, we propose a priority matrix that combines multiple signals:

| Vulnerability Type | CVV-CVSS Score | PCI DSS Impact | Implementation Complexity | Priority Level |
|-------------------|----------------|---------------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Bypass - Value | 7.0-10.0 | Critical | Low | P0 (Critical) |
| Bypass - Parameter | 7.0-10.0 | Critical | Low | P0 (Critical) |
| Bypass - Control Flow | 7.0-10.0 | Critical | Medium | P0 (Critical) |
| Validation Logic - Weak Algorithm | 5.0-6.9 | High | Medium | P1 (High) |
| Validation Logic - Insufficient Entropy | 5.0-6.9 | High | Medium | P1 (High) |
| Validation Logic - Timing Attack | 4.0-5.9 | Medium | High | P2 (Medium) |
| Integration - Insecure Transmission | 7.0-10.0 | Critical | Low | P0 (Critical) |
| Integration - Improper Storage | 7.0-10.0 | Critical | Low | P0 (Critical) |
| Integration - Logging | 4.0-6.9 | High | Medium | P1 (High) |

### 3.3 CVV Validation Vulnerability Detection Methodology

Drawing from the insights on vulnerability assessment, we propose a comprehensive methodology for detecting CVV validation vulnerabilities:

#### 3.3.1 Static Analysis Techniques

- **Code review**: Systematic examination of payment processing code to identify CVV validation weaknesses
- **Pattern matching**: Identification of known vulnerable patterns in CVV handling code
- **Dataflow analysis**: Tracking of CVV data through the application to identify improper handling

#### 3.3.2 Dynamic Testing Approaches

- **Bypass testing**: Attempting various techniques to bypass CVV validation
- **Boundary testing**: Testing edge cases in CVV validation logic
- **Integration testing**: Verifying proper handling of CVV data across system boundaries

#### 3.3.3 Compliance Testing

- **PCI DSS requirement mapping**: Mapping tests to specific PCI DSS requirements
- **Gap analysis**: Identifying areas where current implementations fall short of compliance requirements
- **Remediation validation**: Verifying that identified vulnerabilities have been properly addressed

## 4. PCI DSS Compliance and Vulnerability Scoring Integration

### 4.1 Mapping Vulnerability Scoring to PCI DSS Requirements

The PCI DSS framework includes several requirements directly relevant to CVV validation security. We map these requirements to vulnerability scoring considerations:

#### 4.1.1 Requirement 3: Protect Stored Cardholder Data

- **3.2**: Do not store sensitive authentication data after authorization (including CVV)
- **Vulnerability Scoring Impact**: Vulnerabilities that lead to CVV storage should receive the highest severity scores
- **Detection Focus**: Identify any persistent storage of CVV data in databases, logs, or cache

#### 4.1.2 Requirement 4: Encrypt Transmission of Cardholder Data

- **4.1**: Use strong cryptography and security protocols to safeguard sensitive cardholder data during transmission
- **Vulnerability Scoring Impact**: Vulnerabilities in transmission security should be prioritized based on the encryption strength and potential exposure
- **Detection Focus**: Identify unencrypted transmission of CVV data or weak encryption implementations

#### 4.1.3 Requirement 6: Develop and Maintain Secure Systems

- **6.5**: Address common coding vulnerabilities in software development processes
- **Vulnerability Scoring Impact**: Code-level vulnerabilities should be scored based on their potential impact on CVV validation integrity
- **Detection Focus**: Identify insecure coding practices in CVV validation implementation

#### 4.1.4 Requirement 8: Identify and Authenticate Access

- **8.2**: Implement strong authentication for all access to system components
- **Vulnerability Scoring Impact**: Authentication vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access to CVV processing systems should receive high scores
- **Detection Focus**: Identify weak authentication mechanisms protecting CVV processing functionality

### 4.2 PCI DSS Compliance Gap Assessment Framework

To systematically identify compliance gaps related to CVV validation, we propose a framework that integrates vulnerability scoring with compliance assessment:

#### 4.2.1 Compliance Control Mapping

| PCI DSS Requirement | Control Implementation | Vulnerability Types | Assessment Methodology |
|---------------------|------------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 3.2 (No CVV Storage) | Data handling policies | Storage vulnerabilities | Code review, log analysis |
| 4.1 (Secure Transmission) | Encryption implementation | Transmission vulnerabilities | Network analysis, API testing |
| 6.5 (Secure Coding) | Secure SDLC | Logic vulnerabilities | Static analysis, code review |
| 8.2 (Authentication) | Access controls | Authorization vulnerabilities | Penetration testing |

#### 4.2.2 Compliance Scoring Methodology

To quantify compliance gaps, we propose a scoring methodology that considers:

1. **Control Implementation Status**: Fully implemented (0), Partially implemented (0.5), Not implemented (1)
2. **Vulnerability Severity**: Based on CVV-CVSS score (0-10)
3. **Compliance Gap Score** = Control Implementation Status × Vulnerability Severity

This approach allows for prioritization of compliance gaps based on their security impact, addressing the prioritization challenges identified in the vulnerability scoring systems study.

### 4.3 Continuous Compliance Monitoring

To address the dynamic nature of vulnerabilities, we propose a continuous monitoring approach that integrates vulnerability scoring with compliance assessment:

#### 4.3.1 Automated Scanning and Testing

- Regular automated scanning for CVV validation vulnerabilities
- Continuous integration of security testing in the development pipeline
- Automated compliance checks against PCI DSS requirements

#### 4.3.2 Vulnerability Trend Analysis

- Tracking of vulnerability scores over time
- Identification of recurring vulnerability patterns
- Correlation of vulnerability trends with compliance status

#### 4.3.3 Compliance Dashboard

- Real-time visibility into compliance status
- Prioritized view of vulnerabilities based on compliance impact
- Tracking of remediation progress

## 5. Non-AI Based Prevention Strategies

### 5.1 Server-Side Validation Enhancements

Based on the vulnerability assessment insights, we propose the following non-AI based prevention strategies for server-side CVV validation:

#### 5.1.1 Robust Validation Logic

- **Strict format validation**: Enforce proper CVV format (3-4 digits depending on card type)
- **Comprehensive validation flow**: Ensure CVV validation is properly integrated in the transaction processing flow
- **Fail-secure design**: Design validation to fail closed rather than open when errors occur

#### 5.1.2 Anti-Bypass Mechanisms

- **Parameter presence enforcement**: Verify that CVV parameter is present and not empty
- **Parameter integrity validation**: Verify that CVV parameter has not been tampered with
- **Control flow integrity**: Implement checks to ensure validation steps cannot be bypassed

#### 5.1.3 Secure Integration Patterns

- **Tokenization**: Replace CVV with a token for internal processing
- **End-to-end encryption**: Encrypt CVV data from point of entry to validation
- **Immediate data disposal**: Remove CVV data from memory as soon as validation is complete

### 5.2 Secure Merchant Integration Guidelines

To address integration vulnerabilities, we provide the following guidelines for secure merchant integration:

#### 5.2.1 Secure API Design

- **Mandatory CVV validation**: Design APIs to require CVV validation for all card-not-present transactions
- **Validation feedback**: Provide appropriate error messages without revealing sensitive information
- **Rate limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks on CVV values

#### 5.2.2 Implementation Best Practices

- **Server-side validation**: Always validate CVV on the server, never rely solely on client-side validation
- **Secure transmission**: Use TLS 1.2+ for all communication containing CVV data
- **No storage**: Never store CVV data, even temporarily

#### 5.2.3 Integration Testing Requirements

- **Vulnerability testing**: Test for common CVV validation vulnerabilities before deployment
- **Compliance verification**: Verify PCI DSS compliance of the integration
- **Regular security assessments**: Conduct regular security assessments of the integration

### 5.3 Implementation Roadmap

To implement the proposed prevention strategies, we provide a phased roadmap:

#### 5.3.1 Phase 1: Assessment and Planning

- Conduct comprehensive vulnerability assessment of current CVV validation implementation
- Map identified vulnerabilities to PCI DSS requirements
- Develop remediation plan based on vulnerability priority

#### 5.3.2 Phase 2: Implementation of Core Controls

- Implement robust server-side validation logic
- Deploy anti-bypass mechanisms
- Establish secure integration patterns

#### 5.3.3 Phase 3: Verification and Continuous Improvement

- Verify effectiveness of implemented controls
- Establish continuous monitoring and testing
- Implement process improvements based on findings

## 6. CVV Validation Risk Assessment Matrix

To provide a structured approach to risk assessment for CVV validation vulnerabilities, we propose a risk assessment matrix that incorporates the insights from vulnerability scoring systems:

### 6.1 Risk Factors

- **Vulnerability Severity**: Based on CVV-CVSS score (0-10)
- **Exploitation Likelihood**: Probability of exploitation (Low, Medium, High)
- **Business Impact**: Potential financial and reputational impact (Low, Medium, High)
- **Detection Capability**: Ability to detect exploitation (Low, Medium, High)

### 6.2 Risk Calculation

Risk Level = Vulnerability Severity × Exploitation Likelihood × Business Impact × (1/Detection Capability)

### 6.3 Risk Assessment Matrix

| Vulnerability Type | Severity | Exploitation Likelihood | Business Impact | Detection Capability | Risk Level |
|-------------------|----------|-------------------------|-----------------|----------------------|------------|
| Bypass - Value | 9 | High (0.9) | High (0.9) | Low (0.3) | 24.3 |
| Bypass - Parameter | 8 | High (0.9) | High (0.9) | Medium (0.6) | 10.8 |
| Validation Logic - Weak | 7 | Medium (0.6) | Medium (0.6) | Medium (0.6) | 4.2 |
| Integration - Storage | 10 | Medium (0.6) | High (0.9) | High (0.9) | 6.0 |

This matrix allows for prioritization of vulnerabilities based on their overall risk level, addressing the prioritization challenges identified in the vulnerability scoring systems study.

## 7. Practical Implementation Examples

    # Ensure CVV is present
    if cvv is None or cvv == "":
        log_security_event("CVV_MISSING", mask_card_number(card_number))
        return False
    
    # Validate CVV format based on card type
    if card_type in ["visa", "mastercard", "discover"]:
        if not (cvv.isdigit() and len(cvv) == 3):
            log_security_event("CVV_INVALID_FORMAT", mask_card_number(card_number))
            return False
    elif card_type == "amex":

            return False
    else:
        log_security_event("UNKNOWN_CARD_TYPE", mask_card_number(card_number))
        return False
    
    # Perform actual CVV validation with payment processor
    result = payment_processor.validate_cvv(card_number, cvv)
    
    # Audit validation result without logging CVV
    if not result:
        log_security_event("CVV_VALIDATION_FAILED", mask_card_number(card_number))
    
    # Clear CVV from memory as soon as possible
    del cvv
    
    return result
```
