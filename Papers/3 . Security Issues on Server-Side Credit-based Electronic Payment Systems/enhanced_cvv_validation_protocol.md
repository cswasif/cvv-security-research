4. Session key encrypted using master CVV key
5. Encrypted session key stored in Tier 2 HSM
```

**Step 2: Key Association**
```

3. CVV access permissions configured
4. CVV retention policy applied
```

### 2.2 CVV Validation Process

**Step 1: Validation Request**
```
1. Merchant initiates payment with CVV
2. CVV validation request sent to Tier 1 service
3. Request authenticated using merchant credentials
4. Request validated for transaction context
```

**Step 2: CVV Retrieval**
```
1. Tier 1 service requests CVV from Tier 3 storage
2. CVV retrieved using encrypted reference
3. CVV decrypted using ephemeral session key from Tier 2
4. CVV validated against provided value
```

**Step 3: Validation Response**
```
1. CVV validation result returned to merchant
2. CVV data immediately purged from memory
3. Validation event logged for audit
4. CVV key rotated after validation
```

### 2.3 CVV Key Rotation
