## Paper 1: Security Certification in Payment Card Industry (Rahaman et al., 2019)

### Key Findings

1. **PCI DSS Compliance Gaps**: There is a significant gap between PCI DSS specifications and real-world enforcement. 86% of 1,203 surveyed e-commerce websites had at least one vulnerability that should have disqualified them as non-compliant.

3. **Self-Assessment Limitations**: Self-assessment questionnaires (SAQs) consist of close-ended questions that may not capture the nuanced security posture of an organization.

4. **Secure Merchant Integration**: The study developed guidelines for secure merchant integration, emphasizing the importance of proper implementation of security controls.
